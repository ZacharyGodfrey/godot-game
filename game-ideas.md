# Game Ideas

A list of ideas for games that could be made.

---

## Creature Hunter

Spyro with guns. You move through each area shooting creatures and collecting items.

As you explore each area, you find entry points into new areas.

### Creatures

Names are temporary.

- Ants: wander, flee, and fight in that order by proximity
- Spiders: wander and fight, no flee option
- Scorpions: always in fight mode, stay within a radius of their origin point

### Weapons

- Pistol: kills ants with one shot, breaks spiders into several ants, kills scorpions in three shots. Close range, unlimited ammo.
- Rifle: kills everything with one shot, doesnâ€™t break spiders. Long range, limited ammo.

You can put your weapon away to switch to third-person view and run faster.

### Features

- Exploration and platforming
- Collection and completion
- Combat and survival

## Sleepwalkers

**TLDR:** It's essentially a PvE zombie survival shooter but way more chill.

You play as a young scout on a camping trip in a park. You wake up in the middle of the night to find that all of the adults are sleepwalking. Armed with a water gun and water balloons, you must wet the adults to wake them up before they successfully grab you, hold you down until you fall asleep, and turn you into a sleepwalker too!

Each day cycle is a safe time to resupply, explore the environment, and prepare for the night ahead.

Each night cycle is a level of the game. Every night, more and more sleepwalkers will come for you. If you survive until sunrise without being turned into a sleepwalker, then you complete the level.

*Badges* can be earned for accomplishing feats of skill.

*Collectables* can be found by exploring the environment.

- Day and night cycles
- First-person and third-person perspective
- Low-poly art style
- Could be expanded into an online cooperative PvE game

## Platformer

The game will be a small, open-world, third-person, exploration and platformer game set on an island floating in the sky. The art style will be low-poly with a bright, happy color palette. The overall experience should feel relaxing, lightweight, and low-consequence.

The primary goal of the game will be to fully explore the island - reaching all of the designated points of interest - by platforming. As a side goal, there will be a number of hidden objects spread around the world to be collected.

**No Death:** In keeping with the low-consequence feel of the game, the player cannot die. Instead, falling off the island simply resets the player to their last safe location on land.

**No Words:** In order to keep the game as accessible as possible, there won't be any words in the game world. This means no dialogue to read, no signs with writing, etc. This also means no heads-up display (HUD). The game should intuitively show you where to go. The use of some symbols may be necessary, but I'll try to avoid those too.

- Use a to-do list to guide the player.
- Make menus look like paper with writing on it.
- The game should have a bright, happy look to it.
- The game should feel relaxing, lightweight, low-consequence.
- The game should play like an adventure puzzle.
- The player should explore the environment and discover what needs to be done.
- Only add items to the to-do list when the player discovers something in the environment.
- Keep the player abilities limited to movement and environment interaction.
- Avoid using a HUD to display information. Let the environment speak for itself.
- Add some secret tasks that don't appear until they're accomplished.
- Add hidden items in the environment to be collected.

## Home Defense

A single-player FPS game where you defend your home from various threats.

- Design an interesting house (my dream home)
- Design a cool weapon
- Design compelling enemies

More details TBD.

## Casual Shooter

A casual, browser-based, low-poly, sandbox shooter that skips the grind and respects your time.

### Casual

The FPS genre has become less fun as long grinds and microtransactions are needed to access that guns that players want to use. Combined with skill-based matchmaking forcing every match to feel like a high-stakes tournament, FPS games feel more stressful than relaxing and fun.

I want to bring the fun back to the FPS genre with a game that appeals to the casual gamer - especially the gamer who only has enough time to hop on for a couple matches every once in a while.

### Browser-Based

Sign into your account from any web browser and jump into the action. There is no need to download or install anything, and you'll always be up to date when new content drops.

### Low-Poly

A simplified art style puts the focus on gameplay mechanics and tactics rather than realistic graphics. This also improves the frame rate and performance even on low-spec computers and allows the game to be developed in less time and at a lower cost.

### Sandbox Shooter

As a sandbox shooter, the weapon selection is simplified. Instead of having several different weapons within each weapon class that have slightly different stats, there is a single weapon per class with a base set of stats onto which you add attachments and apply modifications to tweak the performance to your liking.

### No Grind

It's annoying to have to play for a long time with guns you don't like in order to unlock the gun you really want to use. Everything will be unlocked from the start. The fun is not in working to unlock what you like, but in setting up your class in the way that best suits your style of play. With everything available, you get to play the way you want without grinding for it first.

### Respect Players' Time

#### No Intro Video

Intro videos are filler content that add no value to the player. When you only have a little while to play, you don't want to spend a lot of your time waiting through a useless video.

#### No SBMM

Lobbies arranged by ping are assembled faster, reduce lag issues for everyone, and make the gameplay less sweaty. Sure, players will get a more varied mix of skill levels in their matches, but that's what makes them fun.

### Gameplay Ideas

I want the game to be as small as possible while still being fun. Here's the MVP:

- One game mode
- One map
- One weapon
- One attachment category
- One attachment option
- One equipment option

Once that's implemented, here's what I'd add to make it more fun:

- Additional weapon categories
- Additional attachment options
- Additional attachment categories
- Additional equipment options
- Additional maps
