# Game Ideas

A list of ideas for games that could be made.

## Platformer

The game will be a small, open-world, third-person, exploration and platformer game set on an island floating in the sky. The art style will be low-poly with a bright, happy color palette. The overall experience should feel relaxing, lightweight, and low-consequence.

The primary goal of the game will be to fully explore the island - reaching all of the designated points of interest - by platforming. As a side goal, there will be a number of hidden objects spread around the world to be collected.

**No Death:** In keeping with the low-consequence feel of the game, the player cannot die. Instead, falling off the island simply resets the player to their last safe location on land.

**No Words:** In order to keep the game as accessible as possible, there won't be any words in the game world. This means no dialogue to read, no signs with writing, etc. This also means no heads-up display (HUD). The game should intuitively show you where to go. The use of some symbols may be necessary, but I'll try to avoid those too.

## Casual Shooter

A casual, browser-based, low-poly, sandbox shooter that skips the grind and respects your time.

### Casual

The FPS genre has become less fun as long grinds and microtransactions are needed to access that guns that players want to use. Combined with skill-based matchmaking forcing every match to feel like a high-stakes tournament, FPS games feel more stressful than relaxing and fun.

I want to bring the fun back to the FPS genre with a game that appeals to the casual gamer - especially the gamer who only has enough time to hop on for a couple matches every once in a while.

### Browser-Based

Sign into your account from any web browser and jump into the action. There is no need to download or install anything, and you'll always be up to date when new content drops.

### Low-Poly

A simplified art style puts the focus on gameplay mechanics and tactics rather than realistic graphics. This also improves the frame rate and performance even on low-spec computers and allows the game to be developed in less time and at a lower cost.

### Sandbox Shooter

As a sandbox shooter, the weapon selection is simplified. Instead of having several different weapons within each weapon class that have slightly different stats, there is a single weapon per class with a base set of stats onto which you add attachments and apply modifications to tweak the performance to your liking.

### No Grind

It's annoying to have to play for a long time with guns you don't like in order to unlock the gun you really want to use. Everything will be unlocked from the start. The fun is not in working to unlock what you like, but in setting up your class in the way that best suits your style of play. With everything available, you get to play the way you want without grinding for it first.

### Respect Players' Time

#### No Intro Video

Intro videos are filler content that add no value to the player. When you only have a little while to play, you don't want to spend a lot of your time waiting through a useless video.

#### No SBMM

Lobbies arranged by ping are assembled faster, reduce lag issues for everyone, and make the gameplay less sweaty. Sure, players will get a more varied mix of skill levels in their matches, but that's what makes them fun.

### Gameplay Ideas

I want the game to be as small as possible while still being fun. Here's the MVP:

- One game mode
- One map
- One weapon
- One attachment category
- One attachment option
- One equipment option

Once that's implemented, here's what I'd add to make it more fun:

- Additional weapon categories
- Additional attachment options
- Additional attachment categories
- Additional equipment options
- Additional maps
