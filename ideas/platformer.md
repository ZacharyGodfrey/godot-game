# Platformer

The game will be a small, open-world, third-person, exploration and platformer game set on an island floating in the sky. The art style will be low-poly with a bright, happy color palette. The overall experience should feel relaxing, lightweight, and low-consequence.

The primary goal of the game will be to fully explore the island - reaching all of the designated points of interest - by platforming. As a side goal, there will be a number of hidden objects spread around the world to be collected.

**No Death:** In keeping with the low-consequence feel of the game, the player cannot die. Instead, falling off the island simply resets the player to their last safe location on land.

**No Words:** In order to keep the game as accessible as possible, there won't be any words in the game world. This means no dialogue to read, no signs with writing, etc. This also means no heads-up display (HUD). The game should intuitively show you where to go. The use of some symbols may be necessary, but I'll try to avoid those too.

- Use a to-do list to guide the player.
- Make menus look like paper with writing on it.
- The game should have a bright, happy look to it.
- The game should feel relaxing, lightweight, low-consequence.
- The game should play like an adventure puzzle.
- The player should explore the environment and discover what needs to be done.
- Only add items to the to-do list when the player discovers something in the environment.
- Keep the player abilities limited to movement and environment interaction.
- Avoid using a HUD to display information. Let the environment speak for itself.
- Add some secret tasks that don't appear until they're accomplished.
- Add hidden items in the environment to be collected.
