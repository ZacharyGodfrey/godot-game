# Sleepwalkers

**TLDR:** It's essentially a PvE zombie survival shooter but way more chill.

You play as a young scout on a camping trip in a park. You wake up in the middle of the night to find that all of the adults are sleepwalking. Armed with a water gun and water balloons, you must wet the adults to wake them up before they successfully grab you, hold you down until you fall asleep, and turn you into a sleepwalker too!

Each day cycle is a safe time to resupply, explore the environment, and prepare for the night ahead.

Each night cycle is a level of the game. Every night, more and more sleepwalkers will come for you. If you survive until sunrise without being turned into a sleepwalker, then you complete the level.

*Badges* can be earned for accomplishing feats of skill.

*Collectables* can be found by exploring the environment.

- Day and night cycles
- First-person and third-person perspective
