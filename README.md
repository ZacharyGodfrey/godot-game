# Godot Game

A first attempt at making a 3D game with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) and [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).

## Description

The game will be a small, open-world, third-person, exploration and platforming puzzle game set on an island floating in the sky. The art style will be low-poly with a bright, happy color palette. The overall experience should feel relaxing, lightweight, and low-consequence.

The player character will be an astronaut in a white spacesuit and helmet.

The primary goal of the game will be to reach all of the Points of Interest (denoted with bright yellow beams of light) by navigating various platforming puzzles. As a side goal, there will be a number of hidden objects spread around the world to be collected.

Along the way, there will be small areas of the world that are not tied to these goals. These areas will offer some environmental interaction - more to come on this later.

As a stretch goal, it would be cool if reaching each of the Points of Interest caused the game world to be permanently changed in some way (add vegetation or animals, change the weather or time of day, unlock new areas, etc.) - though this would not be strictly necessary in the core of the game.

#### Limitations:

**No Death:** In keeping with the low-consequence feel of the game, the player cannot die. Instead, falling off the island simply resets the player to their last safe location on land.

**No Words:** In order to keep the game as accessible as possible, there won't be any words in the game world. This means no dialogue to read, no signs with writing, etc. This also means no heads-up display (HUD). The game should intuitively show you where to go. The use of some symbols may be necessary, but I'll try to avoid those too.
