# Godot Game

A first attempt at making a game with the Godot engine.

## Description

The game will be a small, open-world, third-person, exploration game set on an island with an art style that is low-poly, but not blocky, with a bright and happy color palette.

## Ideas

- Use a to-do list to guide the player.
- Make menus look like paper with writing on it.
- The game should have a bright, happy look to it.
- The game should feel relaxing, lightweight, low-consequence.
- The game should play like an adventure puzzle.
- The player should explore the environment and discover what needs to be done.
- Only add items to the to-do list when the player discovers something in the environment.
- Keep the player abilities limited to movement and environment interaction.
- Avoid using a HUD to display information. Let the environment speak for itself.
- Add some secret tasks that don't appear until they're accomplished.
- Add hidden items in the environment to be collected.
- Add smaller islands in the ocean around the main island.
- Maybe add some floating islands in the sky like Avatar's Hallelujah Mountains.
- (T.S. Eliot) "And the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time."
