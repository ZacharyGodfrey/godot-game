# Godot Game

A first attempt at making a 3D game with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) and [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).

## Description

The game will be a small, open-world, third-person, exploration and puzzle game set on an island floating in the sky. The art style will be low-poly with a bright, happy color palette. The overall experience should feel relaxing, lightweight, and low-consequence.

The player character will be an astronaut in a white spacesuit and helmet.

On the island, there will be a man-made structure with many electronic systems that are without power. These will need to be powered on in various ways: flip a switch, plug in a cable, install batteries, uncover solar panels, unblock water flowing into a turbine, etc. As these systems are powered on, they will unlock other parts of the island to explore and restore.

The primary goal of the game will be to fully restore power to the island structure. As a side goal, there will be a number of hidden objects spread around the world to be collected.

As players observe the floating island, there are many questions they might ask:

- How is this island floating in the sky?
- Why did people build a structure on the island?
- Why does the structure require so much electricity?
- How has the structure fallen into disrepair?
- How did we get to the island?
- What happens when power is fully restored?

If I were building a full-length game, it would be worth writing a backstory to answer these questions. Since this is a small game with a limited scope, it might be better to leave the player to imagine their own answers.

### Limitations:

**No Death:** In keeping with the low-consequence feel of the game, the player cannot die. Instead, falling off the island simply resets the player to their last safe location on land.

**No Words:** In order to keep the game as accessible as possible, there won't be any words in the game world. This means no dialogue to read, no signs with writing, etc. This also means no heads-up display (HUD). The game should intuitively show you where to go. The use of some symbols may be necessary, but I'll try to avoid those too.
